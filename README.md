# Token Creation

I have created a token named Oreo with Solidity. the program can keep track of the total supply of tokens, mint, and burn the token. 

The abbreviation of my token is 'ORO' which is created using solidity for the Ethereum blockchain. this program is capable of minting and burning tokens. it can give us a total supply of tokens.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

For the program to run, we can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension. Copy and paste myToken.sol into the file.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile myToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Now at the left bottom side of the page, there is a section called Deployed Contracts. below that, as you can see contract is deployed and by clicking into MYTOKEN there are functions like burnCoin, mintCoin which will burn and mint coin respectively after that balances button will give a balance of the address that you put into the text field on the right side of the button. further, there are 3 more buttons that will give the token name, its abbreviation and total supply.
