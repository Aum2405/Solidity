I have developed a token called Oreo using Solidity. The program enables tracking of the total coin supply, as well as the minting and burning of tokens.

Description
The Oreo token, also known as ORO, is built using Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain. This program allows for the creation, burning, and tracking of the token supply.

Getting Started
Executing the Program
To run this program, you can utilize Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Access the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
2. Create a new file by selecting the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension and paste the code from Firstsolidity.sol into it.
3. To compile the code, navigate to the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Ensure that the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" or a compatible version, and click on the "Compile Firstsolidity.sol" button.
4. Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by going to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Choose the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu and click on the "Deploy" button.
5. To interact with the deployed contract, locate the "Deployed Contracts" section at the bottom left of the page. Under "MYTOKEN," you will find functions such as "burnCoin" and "mintCoin," which allow for token burning and minting, respectively. Additionally, the "balances" button provides the balance of a specific address entered in the adjacent text field. Lastly, there are three buttons that display the token's name, abbreviation, and total supply.
